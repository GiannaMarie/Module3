<!--insert an href within the link below that references a new html page you create in your root folder called fans.html. this new page should include, at a minimum, an HTML form that would allow a user to enter their personal information to sign up for a fan club for your band or movie. Don't forget a Submit button! Note that these forms don't have to actually collect the information that is entered. This would require technology that is beyond the scope of this course-->
